# Bushy Tail Addon for Mannequin

The **Bushy Tail** addon is a DLC package for the [Mannqeuin doftware][mq] that
gives characters a bushy tail. This may be useful for characters which have more
animal-like qualities such as tails and fox ears.

This addon is used internally to generate the portraits for Chelsea Roslyn in
_Indexing Your Heart_.
